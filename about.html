                        Coronavirus is a family of viruses that can cause many illnesses,
                        right from the common cold to more severe life-threatening diseases 
                        like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory
                        Syndrome (SARS). The virus outbreak is said to have started in an illegal 
                        seafood and wildlife meat market in Wuhan. “Reports suggest that snakes were 
                        sold in the local seafood market in Wuhan. It is quite possible that the 
                        2019-nCoV jumped from the host species, i.e., bats, to snakes and then to 
                        humans at the beginning of the outbreak. It is not yet known how the virus 
                        could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts,” says Dr Aggarwal.
                        The mode of transmission is unclear but available evidence points to human-to-human 
                        transmission occurring between close contacts through the respiratory route.
