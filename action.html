                        Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
                        Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness 
                        and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical 
                        problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more 
                        likely to develop serious illness.The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well 
                        informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and 
                        others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not 
                        touching your face.The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge 
                        from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
